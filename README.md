# cpp_projs
A collection of simple projects i made while learning C++

# Prerequisite

* A c++ compiler must be installed, preferably g++ (refer to [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/introvideos-cpp))

# Setup

Compile the `exec.cpp` program for easy execution of programs in the repository using this command:
```sh
g++ exec.cpp -std=c++23 -o exec
```
This will create a binary called `exec.out` ( for UNIX systems ) or `exec.exe` ( for windows operating system ).

You can use 
```sh
./exec <program name> <program arguments...>
```

to execute a program directly!

To remove the binary files use the `rm` command like this 
```sh
rm *.exe
# or 
rm *.out
```
